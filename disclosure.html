<h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

<h2>How We Fund This Site</h2>
<p>OpenClaw Guide is an independent resource site. We spend significant time researching and comparing hosting providers, tools, and services so you don't have to. To keep this site running and free for everyone, we participate in affiliate programs with some of the providers we review and recommend.</p>

<h2>What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
<p>Some of the links on this website are affiliate links. This means that if you click on a link and subsequently make a purchase or sign up for a service, we may receive a small commission at no additional cost to you. The price you pay is exactly the same whether you use our affiliate link or go directly to the provider's website.</p>

<h2>Does This Affect Our Reviews?</h2>
<p><strong>No.</strong> Our editorial content is completely independent of our affiliate partnerships. We never accept payment for higher rankings, and our recommendations are based entirely on our hands-on testing and research. We review and recommend services regardless of whether we have an affiliate relationship with them.</p>

<h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>
<ul>
<li>We only recommend services and tools that we have personally tested and believe provide genuine value.</li>
<li>Our rankings and recommendations are never influenced by affiliate commissions.</li>
<li>We clearly identify affiliate links on our site.</li>
<li>We regularly update our content to reflect the latest features and pricing changes.</li>
<li>If a service declines in quality, we will update our recommendation accordingly, regardless of any affiliate relationship.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FTC Compliance</h2>
<p>In accordance with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines, we disclose that some of the links on OpenClaw Guide are affiliate links. We are committed to transparency and want our readers to make informed decisions.</p>

<h2>Questions?</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about our affiliate relationships or review process, please don't hesitate to reach out. We believe in full transparency and are happy to explain how we operate.</p>
